We explored the residential transactions across the UK and London specifically and managed to achieve an optimized RMSE. Unfortunately, the features were not rich enough to have a more accurate prediction thank +-65,000 over a 3 year horizon. Nonetheless our result allows us to have a clear comparison between the expected properties prices and the ones offered in the corona-market economy. 

The model can be run to predict a new observation dated to the current month and any postcode. For example, figure xx shows an updated entry for postcode ‘W4 1PE’ to reflect the expected price of the property in 06-2020. The model does not discriminate between number of beds or baths as there is no data to link transactions to flat descriptors. However, our study is accurate enough to help any individual inform themselves better about real estate price projections to a very high level of detail. The XGB model was run to estimate a comparison on the price for a typical property at ‘W3 7QN’ in 06-2000, the predicted price for the property in 06-2012, and the predicted price for the property and 06-2020. The predicted prices are £242k in 2000, £484k in 2012 (actual value £568k), and £616k in 06-2020. Interesting, huh?
